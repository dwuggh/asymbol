* asymbol
fast symbol input method for latex and org mode inspired by cdlatex

** status
under development yet

** Description
This package classifies a lot of math and non-math symbols and provide a cdlatex-like input method.
*** the reason why I wrote this
The cdlatex's cdlatex-math-symbol function was incrediably helpful that it saved me from memorizing all kinds 
of strange symbols and its codes. But it wasn't good enough, since it contains very limit numbers of symbols, 
and it would be too messy if you add a lot symbols in your customization. So I separated that part of cdlatex, 
enhanced it and made this package. 

** Usage
for now, just use `M-x asymbol/insert-text-or-symbol` for a quick try.
