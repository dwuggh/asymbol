* asymbol
  fast symbol input method for latex and org mode inspired by cdlatex


** Description
   This package classifies a lot of math and non-math symbols and provide a cdlatex-like input method.

*** the reason why I wrote this
    The cdlatex's cdlatex-math-symbol function was incrediably helpful that it saved me from memorizing all kinds 
    of strange symbols and its codes. But it wasn't good enough, since it contains very limit numbers of symbols, 
    and it would be too messy if you add a lot symbols in your customization. So I separated that part of cdlatex, 
    enhanced it and made this package. 
    
** Usage
*** install
   - clone this repository, add its path to your load path.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
     ;; using require
     (require 'asymbol)
     ;; using use-package
     (use-package asymbol
       :init
       ;; a little customization
       (setq asymbol-help-symbol-linewidth 110
	     asymbol-help-tag-linewidth 110)

       ;; enable in org-mode and tex-mode
       (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'asymbol-mode)
       (add-hook 'tex-mode-hook #'asymbol-mode)

       ;; or use globally
       (global-asymbol-mode 1)
       )
   #+end_src
   - using it with cdlatex(if the keybindings conflict):
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
     (add-hook 'org-cdlatex-mode-hook
               (lambda () (interactive)
               (define-key org-cdlatex-mode-map "`" 'asymbol-insert-text-or-symbol)))
   #+end_src

*** usage
    - use "C-`"(asymbol-trigger-key-unicode) to insert unicode symbols, like ⌬, ∲, etc.
    - use "`"(asymbol-trigger-key) in latex and org-mode to insert latex code.
    - use "C-~" to insert latex code in `global-asymbol-map`.
    - use ";" after triggered to input "`"
    - you can customize `asymbol-trigger-key-unicode` and `asymbol-trigger-key`.

*** customization
    You can use customize group. The customization interface is under constructing yet.
